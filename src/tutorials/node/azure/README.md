# Tutorials: Node.js on Azure

1. [Create a new AppService][tutorials-infrastructure] in Azure using Terraform.
2. [Deploy a Node.js application][tutorials-app] to Azure using the Azure CLI.

_\*Note: Step 2 will automatically create an AppService if one does not exist. However, it can be useful to explicitly control (configure and execute) the creation and maintenance of the AppService over time. Step 1 will help you accomplish this._
