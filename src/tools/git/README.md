# git

Like this project, most code in the world is now managed through distributed source control systems, like [`git`][git] and [GitHub][github].

In addition to learning `git`, learn more about working with a ["monorepo"][monorepo] by reading the GitHub article ["Bring your monorepo down to size with sparse-checkout"][github-sparse-checkout].

_Git 2.20 or later is recommended._

_When using GitHub, we strongly recommend you use ["Signed commits"][github-signed-commits]._
