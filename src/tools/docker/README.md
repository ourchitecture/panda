# docker

Executing software consistently across computers is difficult, especially cross-platform software. The platform, software versions, and environment can vary substantially, especially across individual engineer computers. Containers simplifies this by encapsulating or "containerizing" the platform, software, and environment into a unique package or "image".

Container tooling, like [`docker`][docker-get-started] or [`podman`][podman-get-started] enable engineers and automation to consistently run standardized environments. And, standards like the [Open Container Initiative (OCI)][oci] provide a consistent experience when working with container technology.
