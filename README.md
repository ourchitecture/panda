# Patterns and Tutorials

ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to a collaborative architecture workspace on patterns and tutorials.

This repository hopes to serve as a central reference for simple, end-to-end examples that you can scale from rapid prototyping out to resilient, multi-cloud, multi-region, autoscaling deployments. This is a big goal. As a result, examples will be kept as simple as possible, like "hello world"; although, we realize simplicity can be subjective.
