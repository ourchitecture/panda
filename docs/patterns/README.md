# Patterns

Many great patterns emerge from implementations and applied experience. In fact, great implementations can be a realization of patterns, like Cloud Platforms, Kubernetes, the Open Container Initiative, HTML, etc. Sometimes, documenting and studying a pattern independently from an implementation can provide an essential summary and an opportunity for innovation free of implementation bias. Patterns can also define an implementation-agnostic solution.

If you are new to Patterns, start with the Open Group's [introduction to patterns][open-group-intro] and [Brad Appleton's patterns introduction][brad-appleton-intro]. See the definition of Patterns as described in [TOGAF Architecture Patterns][togaf]. Of course, simply searching GitHub and open source projects will reveal many applied patterns.

## Types of Patterns

### Architecture Pattern

An architecture pattern expresses a fundamental structural organization or schema for complex systems. It provides a set of predefined subsystems, specifies their unique responsibilities, and includes the decision-enabling rules and guidelines for organizing the relationships between them. The architecture pattern for a software system illustrates the macro-level structure for the whole software solution. An architectural pattern is a set of principles and a coarse-grained pattern that provides an abstract framework for a family of systems. An architectural pattern improves partitioning and promotes design reuse by providing solutions to frequently recurring problems. Precisely speaking, an architectural pattern comprises a set of principles that shape an application.

### Design Pattern

A design pattern provides a scheme for refining the subsystems or components of a system, or the relationships between them. It describes a commonly recurring structure of communicating components that solves a general design problem within a particular context. The design pattern for a software system prescribes the ways and means of building the software components. The design pattern articulates how the various components within the system collaborate with one another in order to fulfill the desired functionality.
