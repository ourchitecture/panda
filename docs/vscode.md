# Visual Studio Code

[VSCode (`code`)][vscode] is a cross-platform editor that can offer a more consistent engineering experience where a project can share editor settings, extensions, and even a remote development experience with all of their team members and even external contributors.

When opening a project in VS Code, consider installing any of the project's recommended extensions when prompted, opening any project [workspaces][vscode-workspaces], and running any [remote containers][vscode-remote].

[VSCodium][vscodium] offers an alternative, 100% open source licensed version of VSCode. While VSCode itself is open source licensed under MIT, Microsoft supports the _free_ VSCode project under a Microsoft license with telemetry/tracking turned on and a setting to disable it.

Interestingly, the [Theia][theia] project, Eclipse's "Cloud and Desktop IDE Platform", integrates VSCode concepts.

> "[Theia project believes] VS Code is an excellent product. That is why Theia embraces many of the design decisions and even directly supports VS Code extensions."
